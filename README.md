# File Transfer System
This a personal project that consist in two applications:
* A **server** console app that allows file transfering between clients.
* A **client** console app that send and receives files from the server.

This comunication will be based on a custom protocol I created for this purpose. The custom protocol name and documentation will be available in the **docs** folder in the repository's root.

For the tech stack, I will be using **Golang** and **VueJS** (in case I add a GUI for server statistics).
